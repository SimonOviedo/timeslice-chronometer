# timeslice-chronometer
A stopwatch for easily measuring fast-switching time spans

This tool has originally been developed to evaluate screen capturing videos that were recorded during controlled experiments in the area of software engineering. We measured how much time the participants used for which specific activity. With timeslice-chronometer it is possible to switch the measurement of different time slices very fast so evaluating the videos could be done in a fraction of the recorded real-time.
